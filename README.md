# CampusCare-College Maintenance App
The CampusCare app is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the maintenance request process within a college campus. With separate logins for students, faculty, and maintenance staff, the app aims to provide a user-friendly platform for reporting and resolving maintenance issues. The app allows students and faculty members to easily submit maintenance requests whenever they encounter any problems or require assistance with campus maintenance. These requests are then compiled and displayed on a centralized maintenance page accessible to the maintenance staff. Through this platform, maintenance staff can efficiently view and prioritize the submitted requests, ensuring prompt attention to urgent issues. Once a request is addressed and resolved, the maintenance staff can generate a response using pregenerated email template. This feature enables them to provide timely updates to the requestors, keeping them informed about the progress and completion of their requests.By digitizing the maintenance request process and integrating communication through email, the CampusCare app aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, and communication between students, faculty, and maintenance staff, ultimately contributing to an improved maintenance experience within the college campus.
